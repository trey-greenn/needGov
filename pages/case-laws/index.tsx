            <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4">
              Case law (also known as common law or judge-made law) is law established by judicial decisions rather than by statutes or regulations. 
              It forms a key part of the U.S. legal system and many others. When judges decide cases, their interpretations become precedent 
              for future similar cases, creating a body of law based on judicial decisions.
